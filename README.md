# My Army Timer

This is a very simple army countdown timer that I made before going to the army. It’s convenient to host publicly using GitHub Pages, and I used it comfortably as a personal “Dembel Timer.” If you want your own version, just fork the repository and change the timer settings in startDate and targetDate.
